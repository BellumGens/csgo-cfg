# Configuration files for CS:GO

To enable the nadepractice config do the following:

1. Copy `nadeprad.cfg` into `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\cfg`
2. Create an offline game with bots
3. In console type `exec nadeprad`

Learn all the smokes and have fun. The "e" key toggles noclip, and the "l" key gives you all the nades. You can change those in the config.
